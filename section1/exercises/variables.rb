# In the below exercises, write code that achieves
# the desired result. To check your work, run this
# file by entering the following command in your terminal:
# `ruby section1/exercises/variables.rb`

# Example: Write code that saves your name to a variable and
# prints what that variable holds to the terminal:
name = "Harry Potter"
p name

# Write code that saves the string 'Dobby' to a variable and
# prints what that variable holds to the terminal:
house_elf = "Dobby"
p house_elf # YOUR CODE HERE

# Write code that saves the string 'Harry Potter must not return to Hogwarts!'
# and prints what that variable holds to the terminal:
warning = "Harry Potter must not return to Hogwarts!" # YOUR CODE HERE
p warning

# Write code that adds 2 to the `students` variable and
# prints the result:
students = 22
students = students + 2 # YOUR CODE HERE
p students

# Write code that subracts 2 from the `students` variable and
# prints the result:
students = students - 2 # YOUR CODE HERE
p students


# YOU DO:
# Declare three variables, named `first_name`, `is_hungry` and `number_of_pets`.
# Store the appropriate data types in each.
# print all three variables to the terminal.
first_name = "Antonio"
is_hungry = "is"
number_of_pets = 0

p "#{first_name} #{is_hungry} hungry and has #{number_of_pets} pets."

# IN WORDS:
# How did you decide to use the data type you did for each of the three variables above?
# first_name requires a name, is_hungry is either yes or no, and number_of_pets is a number

# Explain.
# Based on the variable name description, I matched the appropriate data. In this case,
# first_name is a string (something that belongs in a sentence), is_hungry can be a string or
# Boolean, and number_of_pets is an integer.


# YOU DO:
# Re-assign the values to the three variables from the previous challenge to different values (but same data type).
# print all three variables to the terminal.
first_name = "Anthony"
is_hungry = "is not"
number_of_pets = 2 + 1

p "#{first_name} #{is_hungry} hungry and has #{number_of_pets} pets."


# YOU DO:
# Using the variables below, print the total number of snacks to the terminal:
healthy_snacks = 6;
junk_food_snacks = 8;

p "The total number of snacks is #{healthy_snacks + junk_food_snacks}."

# FINAL CHECK
#-------------------

# Did you run this file in your terminal to make sure everything printed out to the terminal
  # as you would expect?
