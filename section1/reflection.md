## Section 1 Reflection

1. How did the SuperLearner Article resonate with you? What from this list do you already do? Want to start doing or do more of? Is there anything not on this list, that you would add to it?
*I already do most of this, but it is by no means a mastered skill. Maybe a little more than a year into some major learning shifts and I'm still fine tuning the process. I don't feel I retain as much as I would like and still have trouble explaining concepts at times. This article has motivated me to emphasize teaching and processing more during my learning process by means of incorporating more breaks or pauses to reflect as well as sharing what I've learned. Nothing more I would add.*

1. How would you print the string `"Hello World!"` to the terminal?
`puts "Hello World!"`

1. What character is used to indicate comments in a ruby file?
*an octothrope*

1. Explain the difference between an integer and a float?
*an integer is a whole number and a floating number is a decimal; computations are easiest with integers, however, only one number in a computation needs to be a floating number for the output to be a floating number.*

1. In the space below, create a variable `animal` that holds the string `"zebra"`
`animal = "zebra"`

1. How would you print the string `"zebra"` using the variable that you created above?
`puts animal`

1. What is interpolation? Use interpolation to print a sentence using the variable `animal`.
*interpolation is when data is inserted into a string*

`puts "My favorite animal is the #{animal}."`

1. What method is used to get input from a user?
*the gets method; gets.chomp*

1. Name and describe two common string methods:
*the length method is used to output the number of characters in a string by attaching ".length" to the end of a variable name; the split method is used to break up a string into parts and output as an array by attaching ".split" to the end of a variable name.*
