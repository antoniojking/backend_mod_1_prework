# Learn Ruby The Hard Way 
# Exercise 34: Accessing Elements of Arrays

# here is an array of 6 animals:
animals = ['bear', 'ruby', 'peacock', 'kangaroo', 'whale', 'platypus']


# write out full sentences for each animal, then say them backwards.
# 1. The first (1st) animal is at 0 and is a bear.
# 2. The second (2nd) animal is at 1 and is a ruby.
# 3. The third (3rd) animal is at 2 and is a peacock.
# 4. The fourth (4th) animal is at 3 and is a kangaroo.
# 5. The fifth (5th) animal is at 4 and is a whale.
# 6. The sixth (6th) animal is at 5 and is a platypus.

# Check your answers:
puts "1. The animal at 1 is #{animals[1]}."

puts "2. The third (3rd) animal is #{animals[2]}."

puts "3. The first (1st) animal is #{animals[0]}."

puts "4. The animal at 3 is #{animals[3]}."

puts "5. The fifth (5th) animal is #{animals[4]}."

puts "6. The animal at 2 is #{animals[2]}."

puts "7. The sixth (6th) animal is #{animals[5]}."

puts "8. The animal at 4 is #{animals[4]}."




# Study Drills

# 1. Expalin why the year 2010 in "January 1, 2010" really is 2010 and not 2009?
# (Hint: you can't pick years at random.)

# 2. Write some more arrays and work out similar indexes until you can translate them.

# 3. Use ruby to check you answers.
