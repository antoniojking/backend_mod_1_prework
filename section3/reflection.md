## Section 3 Reflection

1. What are two points from the Growth Mindset article and/or video that either resonated with you, or were brand new to you?
*A lot of this I am already familiar with, however, setting S.M.A.R.T goals and not being afraid to seek help stood out to me because of the references to time management. How planning and strategizing help tackle coding projects in a timely manner. And that seeking constructive feedback from others could mean the difference in developing a project in one month versus one week. I am likely to end up going down the rabbit hole and will need a reminder to keep track of my time. I'm confident I can accomplish this, but appreciate the reminder and validation.*

1. In which ways do you currently demonstrate a Growth Mindset? In which ways do you _not_?
*I understand the importance of making mistakes as well as reflecting on the process. I do this all the time in every aspect of my life. I could be better about seeking challenges that push me more out of my comfort zone.*

1. What is a Hash, and how is it different from an Array?
*a hash is an unordered collection of data where each element is organized into key-value pairs and addressed by name. Also, they are denoted using curly brackets {} where the key and value are linked by a rocket (=>) or symbol (:) and each pair is separated by a comma.*

*an array is an ordered collection of data where each element is organized in a number-indexed list from first to last. They are denoted using square brackets [] with commas separating each value.*

1. In the space below, create a Hash stored to a variable named `pet_store`.  This hash should hold an inventory of items and the number of that item that you might find at a pet store.
```
pet_store {
  fish: 1000,
  10_gallon_tanks: 10,
  50_gallon_tanks: 5,
  100_gallon_tanks: 2,
  filtration_system: 5,
  water_quality_kit: 25
  fish_food: 20
}
```

1. Given the following `states = {"CO" => "Colorado", "IA" => "Iowa", "OK" => "Oklahoma"}`, how would you access the value `"Iowa"`?
`states["IA"]`

1. With the same hash above, how would we get all the keys?  How about all the values?
`states.keys` and `states.values`

1. What is another example of when we might use a hash?  In your example, why is a hash better than an array?
*When exploring new music or making playlist. In this case, I don't ever care about the order. Everything is shuffled and searchable by artist, keyword or song name.*

1. What questions do you still have about hashes?
*It's hard to know what questions to ask when the concept is so new. Seems really useful. I wish more references were provided where we can just read code and see hashes in action.*
